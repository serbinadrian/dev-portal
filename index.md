features:
  - title: Sample text
    details: Sample details. 
  # - title: Atomspace
  #   details: Each MeTTa program is represented as a subgraph of an Atomspace metagraph, and operates centrally by querying and rewriting portions of Atomspaces.

  # - title: Self-modification
  #   details: MeTTa handles highly abstract constructs like run-time self-modifying code simply and naturally. Programs are fully self-reflective – we can read/modify the code inside the programs.
  # - title: Gradual dependent types
  #   details: Type system is one of the most important features in terms of application of MeTTa language. Built-in mathematical reasoning by supporting a state-of-the-art type system.
  # - title: Neural-symbolic integration
  #   details: MeTTa is capable to support neural-symbolic reasoning and handling uncertainties, using probabilistic logical reasoning. 
  # - title: Inference engine
  #   details: MeTTa is essentially nondeterministic that turns its interpreter into an inference engine. The language supports implementing different inference systems, from probabilistic programming to fuzzy logic.
  # - title: Tool for AGI
  #   details: With its open architecture MeTTa embraces very different AI strategies and is intended both for humans to script portions of AGI cognitive processes, and for the programming activity of AGI-related learning and reasoning algorithms themselves.
  # - title: DSL for AI DSLs
  #   details: MeTTa forms the ‘universal translator’ that enables a wide range of AI systems to dynamically collaborate by the creation of compatible Domain Specific Languages within one framework.
  # - title: OpenCog Hyperon
  #   details: MeTTa is the language of the cognitive architecture of OpenCog Hyperon. It functions as the firmware of the wildly variating components that Hyperon is made of and it is the glue that holds everything together.
